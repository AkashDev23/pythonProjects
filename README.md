# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I've been working on as I learn and practice Python programming. Each project is designed to showcase specific concepts and techniques I've learned along the way.

Feel free to explore the projects, contribute, and use them to enhance your Python skills. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. Hangman Game

The "Hangman Game" is a classic word-guessing game. Players have to guess the letters in a hidden word before running out of attempts. It's a great project to practice loops, conditionals, and user input.

### 2. Caesar Cipher

The "Caesar Cipher" project is an encryption and decryption program that uses a simple letter-shifting technique. It's a fun way to learn about string manipulation and cryptography.

### 3. Secret Auction

The "Secret Auction" project is a simulation of a secret bidding process. Participants can anonymously place bids, and the highest bidder wins. It's a fun way to practice loops, conditionals, and user input.

### 4. Basic Calculator

The "Basic Calculator" project is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It's a useful project to practice functions, user interaction, and mathematical operations.

<!-- Add more project descriptions as you create new projects -->
